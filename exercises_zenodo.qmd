title: "Zenodo"

Before storing our repository in Zenodo, we will add some metadata to it, so our material is easily identifiable in Zenodo. We do this by adding a file called `.zenodo.json` to our repository. Here's an example of such a file:

``` json
{
  "title": "Analysis of babynames",
  "upload_type": "publication",
  "publication_type": "report",
  "keywords": [
    "R",
    "quarto",
    "tutorial"
  ],
  "creators": [
    {
      "name": "Geert van Geest",
      "affiliation": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics",
      "orcid": "0000-0002-1561-078X"
    } 
  ]
}
```

## Exercise

Add a `.zenodo.json` file to your repository, and change it accordingly (e.g. at least change the creator name and ORCiD). Consider adding attributes specified [here](https://developers.zenodo.org/#deposit-metadata). After that, add it to the repository, commit the change and push it to the remote.

## Answer

Modify the `.zenodo.json` file and add it to the repo. Stage, commit and push like so:

``` bash
git add .zenodo.json
git commit -m "adds .zenodo.json file"
git push
```

Now that we have added metadata to the repository, we can store it in Zenodo:

-   Browse to [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) and sign up and use your GitHub account.

-   On the top right, click the drop-down menu and select *GitHub*.

-   All the public repositories in your namespace are in the list. Move the switch at the repository you have just created.

-   Now, go to your repository on GitHub and create a release. Do this by selecting *Create a new release* on the right side.

-   Choose a tag that starts with `v` and follows the rules of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so a good first name would be e.g. `v1.0.0`.

-   Choose a release title. This can be anything. The release title of R v4.2.0 is for example `Vigorous Calisthenics`.

-   Click the green button **Publish release**

-   Go back to the [GitHub page on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/) and click *Sync now* at the top right.

-   There should now be a green bar at your repository, and it received a DOI. You can check out the record by clicking on the repository name

## Exercise

Off course we want to show off with the DOI we just assigned. In order to do that, click the DOI badge and copy-paste the markdown syntax to `index.qmd` to show it on the main page of your website. Now, stage, commit and push the change. After that, render and publish the website.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer

An example of the top of `index.qmd`:

``` markdown
---
title: "quarto-tutorial"
---

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/657627364.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/657627364)
```

After that, we run the commands:

``` bash
git add index.qmd
git commit -m "Adds a badge to the website"
git push
```

And the quarto commands:

``` bash
quarto render
quarto publish gh-pages
```
