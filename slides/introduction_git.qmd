## Take control of your versions!

-   Dare to break stuff ➡️ go back to any previous version
-   Define and describe changes
-   Combine versions and changes that started experimentally

  A(first version) --> B(some changes)
  B --> C(Something experimental)
  B --> D(Bug fix)
  C --> E(Merge)
  D --> E
  
  linkStyle 1,3 stroke:red;
```

## Using git for version control

-   At the level of a directory, typically a project
-   Everything is in `.git/`
-   **Commit**: building block -\> defined step through versions
-   **Branch**:
    -   independent sequence of commits
    -   typically merged with a main branch after work is done

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(first version) --commit--> B(some changes)
  B --new branch--> C(Something experimental)
  B --commit--> D(Bug fix)
  C --> E((Merge commit))
  D --> E
  
  linkStyle 1,3 stroke:red;
```

## Collaborating with git

-   Sync with a remote (e.g. on GitHub)
-   All commits are associated with a user

## Committing changes

1.  Stage the files with changes you'd like to commit
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message

`git add index.qmd`

`git commit -m "Adds a paragraph"`

## Project status

`git status`

`git log --oneline`

## Sync with remote

-   Create an empty repository on GitHub

-   Link your local repository to the created repository:

`git remote origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git`

-   Push your local repository to the remote:

`git push -u origin main`

## Ignoring files

-   `.gitignore` enables you to **not** version control files, e.g.:
    -   output files
    -   user-specific files
-   For a typical quarto project, that would be e.g.:
    -   `_site/`
    -   `.Rproj.user`

## Creating tags

-   Tag a special commit

-   Typically this is done to create versions, e.g. `v1.0.0`

-   With `git tag` or creating a release in GitHub

-   For Zenodo: a DOI is linked to a tag

## Quarto and GitHub

-   Store your raw files in the `main` branch

-   Use `quarto publish gh-pages`:

    -   Create a branch called `gh-pages` and push the rendered html files

    -   Tell GitHub to use the files in `gh-pages` to host it as a website

-   Find your website at OWNER.github.io/REPOSITORY

## Quarto and GitHub actions

-   GitHub actions: computations running on the GitHub server that can be triggered by e.g. a push, merge, cron job etc.

-   Let GitHub actions render the content - ultimate reproducibility but:

    -   Need to define your environment (all required R packages etc.)

    -   Requires knowledge on the GitHub actions syntax and concepts

## More git

-   Spend some time to learn it! You'll earn it back quickly 💸
-   Some nice resources:
    -   [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
    -   [Carpentries course on git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
-   If you're new (or smart) consider using a git client, e.g.:
    - Rstudio git interface
    - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
