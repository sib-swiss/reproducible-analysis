## Introduction round

Introduce yourself:

- Your job/study

- Why you are joining

## Communication

-   Tutorial website:

    `sib-swiss.github.io/reproducible-analysis-training`

-   Ask questions at any time!

## Reproducible research

::: incremental
-   *Reproducibility:* The principle stating that results ... should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study/analysis is replicated.
-   Main purpose: the ability to validate
-   Resulting in:
    -   Transparency and open science
    -   Improved collaboration and innovation
:::

## Why would I make my research reproducible?

::: incremental
1.  Because journals/funding agencies require you to..

2.  Share with others:

    -   People will appreciate!

    -   Identify mistakes or bugs

3.  Colleagues can redo your experiments/analysis

4.  [Redo your own experiments/analysis]{.underline}
:::

## Reusability is even better

-   *Reproducibility:* The principle stating that results ... should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study/analysis is replicated.
-   *Reusability:* The extend to which existing digital objects can be used for other purposes than their initial purpose.

## Why can reusable data analysis be difficult?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   Short term goal: get your results ASAP

-   Mid term goal: publish

-   Long term goal: re-use and stand on the shoulder of giants!

-   Like dieting, exercise, proper sleeping..

-   Be successful by making reusability a habit!

### Software

-   Developed continuously

-   Developed by teams

-   Developed for others

-   Data is input

-   Defined interface

-   Extensive testing

-   **Reusability is enforced**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Data analysis

-   Developed 'once'

-   Usually single researcher

-   Developer = user

-   Developed for single dataset

-   Users interact with code

-   Mistakes can go undetected

-   **Reusability is a choice**

## Think like a software engineer

-   Prepare to:

    -   Develop your code further and collaborate

    -   Let others reuse your code

    -   Allow for different data input

-   Important:

    -   Good coding practices

    -   Documentation (this course)

    -   Version control (this course)

## Applying FAIR principles to your analysis

::: incremental
-   Make your analysis Reusable:

    -   **Code**: style + context, version control (git)

    -   **Workflows**: e.g. snakemake, nextflow

    -   **Environments**: e.g. conda, renv, containers

-   Make your analysis Findable:

    -   Unique identifier

    -   Long term storage

    -   Describe
