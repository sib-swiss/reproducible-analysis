## R and Rstudio

Follow the instructions [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download and install R and RStudio. We're going to need R version > 4.1.2 and the latest version of RStudio, so if you were planning to update, now is a good time to do so!

### Quarto

Follow instructions to install quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

### R packages

Install and/or update the following packages from CRAN:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("babynames", "knitr", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

## Git and GitHub

To install and/or update git, follow the instructions of Jennifer Bryan's [happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). 

If you haven't already got one, make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join), and make sure you can push and pull to GitHub either through https or with ssh key. If haven't set that up yet, set up a [Personal Access Token](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html) to enable a connection through https.
